    "- **Target Variable**: Machine failure (binary classification: 0 or 1).\n",

    "**Characteristics of the Dataset:**\n",
    "   - All features are numerical and continuous, making the dataset suitable for a wide range of ML models without requiring extensive preprocessing.\n",
    "   - The target variable (\"Machine failure\") makes the problem a binary classification task, which is ideal for models like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Neural Networks.\n",
    "   - Features like temperatures and rotational speed have ranges that do not vary drastically. However, scaling methods (e.g., standardization) might be necessary for using models that are sensitive to feature scaling (e.g., SVM, Neural Networks).\n",
    "   - The dataset might exhibit non-linear relationships or interactions between features, favoring models that can capture such complexities (e.g., Random Forests, ANNs).\n",
    "   - With 10,000 rows, the dataset is large enough to benefit from complex models like Random Forests and ANNs while remaining manageable in terms of computationality.\n",
    "   - The data is an imbalanced dataset. This means that there are significantly more target variables measured as 0 instead of 1, meaning that if the model i choose always classifies 0, it might get 95% accuracy, assuming that 500 data points are 1 and 9500 data points are 0.\n",
